  # The `values` parameter contains an object with one attribute per each stream to be updated.
  # The value of each one of these attributes is an array of timestamped values.

  #                hold the stream values.
  #   - location:  (optional) A hash with the current location of the specified
  #                device.
  #   - timestamp: (optional) The timestamp for all the passed values and
  #                location. If ommited, the M2X server's time will be used.
